    <p>
      Hi there! I'm Jacob and I'm passionate about
      <strong> web development and technology</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in 2018, I started on my academic journey in <strong>
        Intelligent Systems
        Engineering
      </strong>, unsure of the adventure that lay ahead. Fast forward to 2021,
      I found my passion when I stumbled upon web technologies and what frontend
      development was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I've been learning and building projects ever since</strong>, and I'm currently
      working with a team of talented developers as a Technology Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love being part of a community, sharing my knowledge, and learning from
      others. Lately, I've participated in <strong>hackathons</strong>
       and <strong> given talks to my university peers</strong>, being part of a
      community known as
      <Link href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/studevs" target="_blank">Studevs</Link>.
    </p>
